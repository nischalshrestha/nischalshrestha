    "text": "Hi, I’m Nischal! I love using Python, R, and JavaScript to build fun and useful tools for data scientists. Currently, I’m a Data Science Educator at RStudio where I’m building autograding tools for Academy. During my internship at RStudio from 2020-2021, I worked on data science packages like learnr, or ggcheck to facilitate grading for interactive tutorials.\n\nI did my PhD at North Carolina State University from 2016-2022. My research interests were mainly in the intersection of human-computer interaction, software engineering and programming languages. In particular, I researched new instructional techniques and tools that can help programmers learn programming languages effectively and efficiently with Chris Parnin in the alt-code lab. You can read my dissertation to learn more!\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, running, lifting, watching/discussing tv shows/movies, listening to or playing music, and coding for fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning learnr: a primer.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wrote a blog post on the RStudio Education blog about how to reason about the learnr. I outline the basic architecture and the tech stacks involved with learnr and a “simple” way to think about the package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 27, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

**CSC 116: Introduction to Computing - Java**

> I taught an introductory course in computer science using Java, which I really enjoyed! It was the first time I was in full charge of lecturing, making exams and trying out live coding in front of the class.

**Mentor for REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates)**

> I mentored [Colton Botta](https://twitter.com/colton_botta) who went on to use his research skills to collaborate with me on my ICSE [paper](http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/cross_language_interference.pdf)!

### 2017

**CSC 116: Introduction to Computing - Java (Online Section)**

> This was the course where I learned how to work with students and the instructor all remotely.

### 2016

**CSC 216: Programming Concepts in Java**

> My first experience teaching a lab section. It was a lot of fun because it required a lot of debugging help for students wrestling with Java as well as IDE issues (Oh Eclipse!).

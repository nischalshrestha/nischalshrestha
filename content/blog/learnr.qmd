I wrote a blog [post](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/07/learning-learnr/) on the RStudio Education blog about how to reason about the [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html). I outline the basic architecture and the tech stacks involved with `learnr` and a "simple" way to think about the package.

In the second post, I will dive into the details behind the experience adding multi-language support, and setup code chaining. I will also talk about recent Python challenges for exercise checking in the third post, so keep an eye out!

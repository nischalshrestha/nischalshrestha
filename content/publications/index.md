**Here We Go Again: Why Is It Difficult for Developers to Learn Another Programming Language?** Nischal Shrestha, Colton Botta, Titus Barik and Chris Parnin. *ICSE 2020: 42nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering.* {{< fa trophy >}} Won an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award. [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3377811.3380352) | [PDF](http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/cross_language_interference.pdf)]
> We found that previous programming language knowledge can interfere with learning another programming language.

**Instrument Designs for Validating Cross-Language Behavioral Differences** Nischal Shrestha and Chris Parnin. *2019 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)* [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2019.8818911) | [PDF](http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/Misconceptions_VLHCC_19.pdf)]
> We designed three instruments that can help identify and validate meaningful behavior differences between two languages to pinpoint potential misconceptions.

**Exploring Tools and Strategies Used During Regular Expression Composition Tasks** Gina R. Bai, Brian Clee, Nischal Shrestha, Carl Chapman, Cimone Wright, Kathryn T. Stolee. *2019 IEEE/ACM 27th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC)* [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC.2019.00039) | [PDF](https://ginabai.github.io/PaperPreprints/icpc2019_RegexVideo.pdf)]

**It's Like Python But: Towards Supporting Transfer of Programming Language Knowledge** Nischal Shrestha, Titus Barik and Chris Parnin. *2018 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)* [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2018.8506508) | [PDF](http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/ItsLikePythonBut.pdf)]
> We explored a prototype transfer tool to support learning new programming languages, given experience in one or more languages.

**Towards Supporting Knowledge Transfer of Programming Language Knowledge** Nischal Shrestha. *2018 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)* [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2018.8506510) | [PDF](http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/TowardsSupportingKnowledgeTransfer.pdf)]
> I outline the current research on learning transfer for programming languages and provide first steps for better transfer support.

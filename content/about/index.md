I am currently a PhD student at NC State University. My research interests lie in the intersection of human-computer interaction, software engineering and programming languages. In particular, I research new instructional techniques and tools that can help programmers learn programming languages effectively and efficiently with [Chris Parnin](http://chrisparnin.me) in the alt-code lab.

I have been working on interactive tools to help understand and debug code in the data science context. During my internship at RStudio from 2020-2021, I worked on data science packages like [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html), or [ggcheck](https://github.com/rstudio/ggcheck/) to facilitate grading for interactive tutorials. For the summer of 2021, I will be interning at Microsoft with [Denae Ford Robinson](http://denaeford.me) and [Thomas Zimmerman](https://thomas-zimmermann.com) with the [Productivity and Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/productivity-and-intelligence/), and the [SAINTES](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/saintes-group/) groups, working on improving the OSS experience.

Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, taking long walks, kickboxing, reading books, watching/discussing movies, listening to or [playing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGoH54n9UCn8ez7NjjhyMA/about) music, and coding for fun.

Recently, Nischal has been working on literate programming for building tutorials. In the summer of 2020, Nischal worked on [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html) at RStudio with [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io) and [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com), adding exercise support for Python (and other languages) as well as the ability to [chain setup code](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/exercises.html#Exercise_Setup). Please reach out if you are active in this area and would like to discuss ideas!
